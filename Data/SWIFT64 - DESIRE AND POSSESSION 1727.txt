       'Tis strange what different thoughts inspire
     In men, Possession and Desire!
     Think what they wish so great a blessing;
     So disappointed when possessing!
       A moralist profoundly sage
     (I know not in what book or page,
     Or whether o'er a pot of ale)
     Related thus the following tale.
       Possession, and Desire, his brother,
     But still at variance with each other,
     Were seen contending in a race;
     And kept at first an equal pace;
     'Tis said, their course continued long,
     For this was active, that was strong:
     Till Envy, Slander, Sloth, and Doubt,
     Misled them many a league about;
     Seduced by some deceiving light,
     They take the wrong way for the right;
     Through slippery by-roads, dark and deep,
     They often climb, and often creep.
       Desire, the swifter of the two,
     Along the plain like lightning flew:
     Till, entering on a broad highway,
     Where power and titles scatter'd lay,
     He strove to pick up all he found,
     And by excursions lost his ground:
     No sooner got, than with disdain
     He threw them on the ground again;
     And hasted forward to pursue
     Fresh objects, fairer to his view,
     In hope to spring some nobler game;
     But all he took was just the same:
     Too scornful now to stop his pace,
     He spurn'd them in his rival's face.
       Possession kept the beaten road,
     And gather'd all his brother strew'd;
     But overcharged, and out of wind,
     Though strong in limbs, he lagg'd behind.
       Desire had now the goal in sight;
     It was a tower of monstrous height;
     Where on the summit Fortune stands,
     A crown and sceptre in her hands;
     Beneath, a chasm as deep as Hell,
     Where many a bold adventurer fell.
     Desire, in rapture, gazed awhile,
     And saw the treacherous goddess smile;
     But as he climb'd to grasp the crown,
     She knock'd him with the sceptre down!
     He tumbled in the gulf profound;
     There doom'd to whirl an endless round.
       Possession's load was grown so great,
     He sunk beneath the cumbrous weight;
     And, as he now expiring lay,
     Flocks every ominous bird of prey;
     The raven, vulture, owl, and kite,
     At once upon his carcass light,
     And strip his hide, and pick his bones,
     Regardless of his dying groans.
