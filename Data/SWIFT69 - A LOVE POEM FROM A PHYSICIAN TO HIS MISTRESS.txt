     By poets we are well assured
     That love, alas! can ne'er be cured;
     A complicated heap of ills,
     Despising boluses and pills.
     Ah! Chloe, this I find is true,
     Since first I gave my heart to you.
     Now, by your cruelty hard bound,
     I strain my guts, my colon wound.
     Now jealousy my grumbling tripes
     Assaults with grating, grinding gripes.
     When pity in those eyes I view,
     My bowels wambling make me spew.
     When I an amorous kiss design'd,
     I belch'd a hurricane of wind.
     Once you a gentle sigh let fall;
     Remember how I suck'd it all;
     What colic pangs from thence I felt,
     Had you but known, your heart would melt,
     Like ruffling winds in cavern pent,
     Till Nature pointed out a vent.
     How have you torn my heart to pieces
     With maggots, humours, and caprices!
     By which I got the hemorrhoids;
     And loathsome worms my anus voids.
     Whene'er I hear a rival named,
     I feel my body all inflamed;
     Which, breaking out in boils and blains,
     With yellow filth my linen stains;
     Or, parch'd with unextinguish'd thirst,
     Small-beer I guzzle till I burst;
     And then I drag a bloated corpus,
     Swell'd with a dropsy, like a porpus;
     When, if I cannot purge or stale,
     I must be tapp'd to fill a pail.
