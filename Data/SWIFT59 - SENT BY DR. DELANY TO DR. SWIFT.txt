     Dear Sir, I think, 'tis doubly hard,
     Your ears and doors should both be barr'd.
     Can anything be more unkind?
     Must I not see, 'cause you are blind?
     Methinks a friend at night should cheer you,â€”
     A friend that loves to see and hear you.
     Why am I robb'd of that delight,
     When you can be no loser by't
     Nay, when 'tis plain (for what is plainer?)
     That if you heard you'd be no gainer?
     For sure you are not yet to learn,
     That hearing is not your concern.
     Then be your doors no longer barr'd:
     Your business, sir, is to be heard.
