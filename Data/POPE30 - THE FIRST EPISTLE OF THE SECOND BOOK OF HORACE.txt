TO AUGUSTUS.142
          While you, great patron of mankind! sustain
          The balanced world, and open all the main;
          Your country, chief, in arms abroad defend,
          At home, with morals, arts, and laws amend;
          How shall the Muse, from such a monarch, steal
          An hour, and not defraud the public weal?

          Edward and Henry, now the boast of fame,
          And virtuous Alfred, a more sacred name,
          After a life of generous toils endured,
          The Gaul subdued, or property secured,                   10
          Ambition humbled, mighty cities storm'd,
          Or laws establish'd, and the world reform'd;
          Closed their long glories with a sigh, to find
          The unwilling gratitude of base mankind!
          All human virtue, to its latest breath,
          Finds envy never conquer'd, but by death.
          The great Alcides, every labour past,
          Had still this monster to subdue at last.
          Sure fate of all, beneath whose rising ray
          Each star of meaner merit fades away!                    20
          Oppress'd we feel the beam directly beat,
          Those suns of glory please not till they set.

          To thee, the world its present homage pays,
          The harvest early, but mature the praise:
          Great friend of liberty! in kings a name
          Above all Greek, above all Roman fame:
          Whose word is truth, as sacred and revered,
          As Heaven's own oracles from altars heard.
          Wonder of kings! like whom, to mortal eyes
          None e'er has risen, and none e'er shall rise.           30

          Just in one instance, be it yet confess'd,
          Your people, sir, are partial in the rest:
          Foes to all living worth except your own,
          And advocates for folly dead and gone.
          Authors, like coins, grow dear as they grow old;
          It is the rust we value, not the gold.
          Chaucer's worst ribaldry is learn'd by rote,
          And beastly Skelton143 heads of houses quote:
          One likes no language but the 'Faery Queen';
          A Scot will fight for 'Christ's Kirk o' the Green';144   40
          And each true Briton is to Ben so civil,
          He swears the Muses met him at The Devil.145

          Though justly Greece her eldest sons admires,
          Why should not we be wiser than our sires?
          In every public virtue we excel;
          We build, we paint, we sing, we dance as well,
          And learnèd Athens to our art must stoop,
          Could she behold us tumbling through a hoop.

          If time improve our wit as well as wine,
          Say at what age a poet grows divine?                     50
          Shall we, or shall we not, account him so,
          Who died, perhaps, an hundred years ago?
          End all dispute; and fix the year precise
          When British bards begin t' immortalise?

          'Who lasts a century can have no flaw,
          I hold that wit a classic, good in law.'
          Suppose he wants a year, will you compound?
          And shall we deem him ancient, right and sound,
          Or damn to all eternity at once,
          At ninety-nine, a modern and a dunce?                    60

          'We shall not quarrel for a year or two;
          By courtesy of England, he may do.'

          Then, by the rule that made the horse-tail bare,146
          I pluck out year by year, as hair by hair,
          And melt down ancients like a heap of snow:
          While you, to measure merits, look in Stowe,
          And estimating authors by the year,
          Bestow a garland only on a bier.

          Shakspeare (whom you and every play-house bill
          Style the divine, the matchless, what you will),         70
          For gain, not glory, wing'd his roving flight,
          And grew immortal in his own despite.
          Ben, old and poor, as little seem'd to heed
          The life to come, in every poet's creed.
          Who now reads Cowley? if he pleases yet,
          His moral pleases, not his pointed wit;
          Forgot his epic, nay, Pindaric art,
          But still I love the language of his heart.

          'Yet surely, surely, these were famous men!
          What boy but hears the sayings of old Ben?               80
          In all debates where critics bear a part,
          Not one but nods and talks of Johnson's art,
          Of Shakspeare's nature, and of Cowley's wit;
          How Beaumont's judgment check'd what Fletcher writ;
          How Shadwell hasty, Wycherley was slow;
          But, for the passions, Southern sure and Rowe.
          These, only these, support the crowded stage,
          From eldest Heywood down to Cibber's age.'

          All this may be; the people's voice is odd,
          It is, and it is not, the voice of God.                  90
          To Gammer Gurton147 if it give the bays,
          And yet deny the 'Careless Husband' praise,
          Or say our fathers never broke a rule;
          Why then, I say, the public is a fool.
          But let them own, that greater faults than we
          They had, and greater virtues, I'll agree.
          Spenser himself affects the obsolete,
          And Sydney's verse halts ill on Roman feet:
          Milton's strong pinion now not Heaven can bound,
          Now serpent-like, in prose he sweeps the ground,        100
          In quibbles, angel and archangel join,
          And God the Father turns a school-divine.
          Not that I'd lop the beauties from his book,
          Like slashing Bentley with his desperate hook,
          Or damn all Shakspeare, like the affected fool
          At court, who hates whate'er he read at school.

          But for the wits of either Charles's days,
          The mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease;
          Sprat, Carew, Sedley, and a hundred more,
          (Like twinkling stars the Miscellanies o'er)            110
          One simile, that solitary shines
          In the dry desert of a thousand lines,
          Or lengthen'd thought that gleams through many a page,
          Has sanctified whole poems for an age.
          I lose my patience, and I own it too,
          When works are censured, not as bad, but new;
          While if our elders break all reason's laws,
          These fools demand not pardon, but applause.

          On Avon's bank, where flowers eternal blow,
          If I but ask, if any weed can grow?                     120
          One tragic sentence if I dare deride
          Which Betterton's grave action dignified,
          Or well-mouth'd Booth with emphasis proclaims,
          (Though but, perhaps, a muster-roll of names)
          How will our fathers rise up in a rage,
          And swear, all shame is lost in George's age!
          You'd think no fools disgraced the former reign,
          Did not some grave examples yet remain,
          Who scorn a lad should teach his father skill,
          And, having once been wrong, will be so still.          130
          He who, to seem more deep than you or I,
          Extols old bards, or Merlin's prophecy,
          Mistake him not; he envies, not admires,
          And to debase the sons, exalts the sires.
          Had ancient times conspired to disallow
          What then was new, what had been ancient now?
          Or what remain'd so worthy to be read
          By learned critics of the mighty dead?

          In days of ease, when now the weary sword
          Was sheathed, and luxury with Charles restored;         140
          In every taste of foreign courts improved,
          'All, by the king's example,148 lived and loved.'
          Then peers grew proud in horsemanship t' excel,
          Newmarket's glory rose, as Britain's fell;
          The soldier breathed the gallantries of France,
          And every flowery courtier writ romance.
          Then marble, soften'd into life, grew warm,
          And yielding metal flow'd to human form:
          Lely149 on animated canvas stole
          The sleepy eye, that spoke the melting soul.            150
          No wonder then, when all was love and sport,
          The willing Muses were debauch'd at court:
          On each enervate string they taught the note
          To pant, or tremble through an eunuch's throat.

          But Britain, changeful as a child at play,
          Now calls in princes, and now turns away.
          Now Whig, now Tory, what we loved we hate;
          Now all for pleasure, now for Church and State;
          Now for prerogative, and now for laws;
          Effects unhappy! from a noble cause.                    160

          Time was, a sober Englishman would knock
          His servants up, and rise by five o'clock,
          Instruct his family in every rule,
          And send his wife to church, his son to school.
          To worship like his fathers, was his care;
          To teach their frugal virtues to his heir;
          To prove, that luxury could never hold;
          And place, on good security, his gold.
          Now times are changed, and one poetic itch
          Has seized the court and city, poor and rich:            170
          Sons, sires, and grandsires, all will wear the bays,
          Our wives read Milton, and our daughters plays,
          To theatres, and to rehearsals throng,
          And all our grace at table is a song.
          I, who so oft renounce the Muses, lie,
          Not ——'s self e'er tells more fibs than I;
          When sick of muse, our follies we deplore,
          And promise our best friends to rhyme no more;
          We wake next morning in a raging fit,
          And call for pen and ink to show our wit.               180

          He served a 'prenticeship, who sets up shop;
          Ward tried on puppies, and the poor, his drop;
          E'en Radcliffe's doctors travel first to France,
          Nor dare to practise till they've learn'd to dance.
          Who builds a bridge that never drove a pile?
          (Should Ripley150 venture, all the world would smile)
          But those who cannot write, and those who can,
          All rhyme, and scrawl, and scribble, to a man.

          Yet, sir, reflect, the mischief is not great;
          These madmen never hurt the Church or State:            190
          Sometimes the folly benefits mankind;
          And rarely avarice taints the tuneful mind.
          Allow him but his plaything of a pen,
          He ne'er rebels, or plots, like other men:
          Flight of cashiers, or mobs, he'll never mind;
          And knows no losses while the Muse is kind.
          To cheat a friend, or ward, he leaves to Peter;
          The good man heaps up nothing but mere metre,
          Enjoys his garden and his book in quiet;
          And then—a perfect hermit in his diet.                 200

          Of little use the man you may suppose,
          Who says in verse what others say in prose;
          Yet let me show, a poet's of some weight,
          And (though no soldier) useful to the State.
          What will a child learn sooner than a song?
          What better teach a foreigner the tongue?
          What's long or short, each accent where to place,
          And speak in public with some sort of grace?
          I scarce can think him such a worthless thing,
          Unless he praise some monster of a king;                210
          Or virtue or religion turn to sport,
          To please a lewd or unbelieving court
          Unhappy Dryden!—in all Charles's days,
          Roscommon only boasts unspotted bays;
          And in our own (excuse some courtly stains)
          No whiter page than Addison remains.
          He from the taste obscene reclaims our youth,
          And sets the passions on the side of truth,
          Forms the soft bosom with the gentlest art,
          And pours each human virtue in the heart,               220
          Let Ireland tell, how wit upheld her cause,
          Her trade supported, and supplied her laws;
          And leave on Swift this grateful verse engraved,
          'The rights a court attack'd, a poet saved.'
          Behold the hand that wrought a nation's cure,
          Stretch'd to relieve the idiot and the poor,
          Proud vice to brand, or injured worth adorn,
          And stretch the ray to ages yet unborn.
          Not but there are, who merit other palms;
          Hopkins and Sternhold glad the heart with psalms:        230
          The boys and girls whom charity maintains,
          Implore your help in these pathetic strains:
          How could devotion touch the country pews,
          Unless the gods bestow'd a proper muse?
          Verse cheers their leisure, verse assists their work,
          Verse prays for peace, or sings down Pope and Turk.
          The silenced preacher yields to potent strain,
          And feels that grace his prayer besought in vain;
          The blessing thrills through all the labouring throng,
          And Heaven is won by violence of song.                  240

          Our rural ancestors, with little blest,
          Patient of labour when the end was rest,
          Indulged the day that housed their annual grain,
          With feasts, and offerings, and a thankful strain:
          The joy their wives, their sons, and servants share,
          Ease of their toil, and partners of their care:
          The laugh, the jest, attendants on the bowl,
          Smooth'd every brow, and open'd every soul:
          With growing years the pleasing license grew,
          And taunts alternate innocently flew.                   250
          But times corrupt, and nature, ill-inclined,
          Produced the point that left a sting behind;
          Till friend with friend, and families at strife,
          Triumphant malice raged through private life.
          Who felt the wrong, or fear'd it, took the alarm,
          Appeal'd to law, and justice lent her arm.
          At length, by wholesome dread of statutes bound,
          The poets learn'd to please, and not to wound:
          Most warp'd to flattery's side; but some, more nice,
          Preserved the freedom, and forbore the vice.            260
          Hence satire rose, that just the medium hit,
          And heals with morals what it hurts with wit.

          We conquer'd France, but felt our captive's charms;
          Her arts victorious triumph'd o'er our arms;
          Britain to soft refinements less a foe,
          Wit grew polite, and numbers learn'd to flow.
          Waller was smooth; but Dryden taught to join
          The varying verse, the full-resounding line,
          The long majestic march, and energy divine:
          Though still some traces of our rustic vein             270
          And splayfoot verse remain'd, and will remain.
          Late, very late, correctness grew our care,
          When the tired nation breathed from civil war.
          Exact Racine, and Corneille's noble fire,
          Show'd us that France had something to admire.
          Not but the tragic spirit was our own,
          And full in Shakspeare, fair in Otway shone:
          But Otway fail'd to polish or refine,
          And fluent Shakspeare scarce effaced a line.
          Even copious Dryden wanted, or forgot,                  280
          The last and greatest art, the art to blot.
          Some doubt, if equal pains, or equal fire
          The humbler muse of Comedy require.
          But in known images of life, I guess
          The labour greater, as the indulgence less.
          Observe how seldom even the best succeed:
          Tell me if Congreve's fools are fools indeed?
          What pert, low dialogue has Farquhar writ!
          How Van151 wants grace, who never wanted wit!
          The stage how loosely does Astraea152 tread,           290
          Who fairly puts all characters to bed:
          And idle Cibber, how he breaks the laws,
          To make poor Pinky eat with vast applause!
          But fill their purse, our poets' work is done,
          Alike to them, by pathos or by pun.

          O you! whom Vanity's light bark conveys
          On Fame's mad voyage by the wind of praise,
          With what a shifting gale your course you ply,
          For ever sunk too low, or borne too high!
          Who pants for glory finds but short repose,             300
          A breath revives him, or a breath o'erthrows.
          Farewell the stage! if just as thrives the play,
          The silly bard grows fat, or falls away.

          There still remains, to mortify a wit,
          The many-headed monster of the pit:
          A senseless, worthless, and unhonour'd crowd;
          Who, to disturb their betters mighty proud,
          Clattering their sticks before ten lines are spoke.
          Call for the farce, the bear, or the black-joke.
          What dear delight to Britons farce affords!             310
          Ever the taste of mobs, but now of lords;
          (Taste, that eternal wanderer, which flies
          From heads to ears, and now from ears to eyes).
          The play stands still; damn action and discourse,
          Back fly the scenes, and enter foot and horse;
          Pageants on pageants, in long order drawn,
          Peers, heralds, bishops, ermine, gold, and lawn;
          The champion too; and, to complete the jest,
          Old Edward's armour beams on Cibber's breast153
          With laughter, sure, Democritus had died,               320
          Had he beheld an audience gape so wide.
          Let bear or elephant be e'er so white,
          The people, sure, the people are the sight!
          Ah, luckless poet! stretch thy lungs and roar,
          That bear or elephant shall heed thee more;
          While all its throats the gallery extends,
          And all the thunder of the pit ascends!
          Loud as the wolves, on Orcas' stormy steep,
          Howl to the roarings of the Northern deep.
          Such is the shout, the long-applauding note,            330
          At Quin's high plume, or Oldfield's petticoat;
          Or when from court a birthday suit bestow'd,
          Sinks the lost actor in the tawdry load.
          Booth enters—hark! the universal peal!
          'But has he spoken?' Not a syllable.
          What shook the stage, and made the people stare?
          Cato's long wig, flower'd gown, and lacquer'd chair.

          Yet lest you think I rally more than teach,
          Or praise malignly arts I cannot reach,
          Let me for once presume to instruct the times,          340
          To know the poet from the man of rhymes:
          'Tis he, who gives my breast a thousand pains,
          Can make me feel each passion that he feigns;
          Enrage, compose, with more than magic art,
          With pity, and with terror, tear my heart:
          And snatch me, o'er the earth, or through the air,
          To Thebes, to Athens, when he will, and where.

          But not this part of the poetic state
          Alone, deserves the favour of the great:
          Think of those authors, sir, who would rely             350
          More on a reader's sense, than gazer's eye.
          Or who shall wander where the Muses sing?
          Who climb their mountain, or who taste their spring?
          How shall we fill a library with wit,
          When Merlin's cave is half unfurnish'd yet?

          My liege! why writers little claim your thought,
          I guess; and, with their leave, will tell the fault:
          We poets are (upon a poet's word)
          Of all mankind, the creatures most absurd:
          The season, when to come, and when to go,               360
          To sing, or cease to sing, we never know;
          And if we will recite nine hours in ten,
          You lose your patience, just like other men.
          Then, too, we hurt ourselves, when to defend
          A single verse, we quarrel with a friend;
          Repeat unask'd; lament, the wit's too fine
          For vulgar eyes, and point out every line.
          But most, when straining with too weak a wing,
          We needs will write epistles to the king;
          And from the moment we oblige the town,                 370
          Expect a place, or pension from the crown;
          Or dubb'd historians by express command,
          To enrol your triumphs o'er the seas and land,
          Be call'd to court to plan some work divine,
          As once for Louis, Boileau and Racine.

          Yet think, great sir! (so many virtues shown)
          Ah think, what poet best may make them known?
          Or choose, at least, some minister of grace,
          Fit to bestow the Laureate's weighty place.

          Charles, to late times to be transmitted fair,          380
          Assign'd his figure to Bernini's154 care;
          And great Nassau to Kneller's hand decreed
          To fix him graceful on the bounding steed;
          So well in paint and stone they judged of merit:
          But kings in wit may want discerning spirit.
          The hero William, and the martyr Charles,
          One knighted Blackmore, and one pension'd Quarles;
          Which made old Ben and surly Dennis swear,
          'No Lord's anointed, but a Russian bear.'

          Not with such majesty, such bold relief,                390
          The forms august of king, or conquering chief.
          E'er swell'd on marble, as in verse have shined
          (In polish'd verse) the manners and the mind.
          Oh! could I mount on the Maeonian wing,
          Your arms, your actions, your repose to sing!
          What seas you traversed, and what fields you fought!
          Your country's peace, how oft, how dearly bought!
          How barbarous rage subsided at your word,
          And nations wonder'd while they dropp'd the sword!
          How, when you nodded, o'er the land and deep,           400
          Peace stole her wing, and wrapp'd the world in sleep;
          Till earth's extremes your mediation own,
          And Asia's tyrants tremble at your throne—
          But verse, alas! your Majesty disdains;
          And I'm not used to panegyric strains:
          The zeal of fools offends at any time,
          But most of all, the zeal of fools in rhyme.
          Besides, a fate attends on all I write,
          That when I aim at praise, they say I bite.
          A vile encomium doubly ridicules:                       410
          There's nothing blackens like the ink of fools.
          If true, a woful likeness; and if lies,
          'Praise undeserved is scandal in disguise:'
          Well may he blush who gives it, or receives;
          And when I flatter, let my dirty leaves
          (Like journals, odes, and such forgotten things
          As Eusden, Philips, Settle, writ of kings)
          Clothe spice, line trunks, or fluttering in a row,
          Befringe the rails of Bedlam and Soho.
