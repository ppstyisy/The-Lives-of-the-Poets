     A set of phrases learn'd by rote;
     A passion for a scarlet coat;
     When at a play, to laugh or cry,
     Yet cannot tell the reason why;
     Never to hold her tongue a minute,
     While all she prates has nothing in it;
     Whole hours can with a coxcomb sit,
     And take his nonsense all for wit;
     Her learning mounts to read a song,
     But half the words pronouncing wrong;
     Has every repartee in store
     She spoke ten thousand times before;
     Can ready compliments supply
     On all occasions cut and dry;
     Such hatred to a parson's gown,
     The sight would put her in a swoon;
     For conversation well endued,
     She calls it witty to be rude;
     And, placing raillery in railing,
     Will tell aloud your greatest failing;
     Nor make a scruple to expose
     Your bandy leg, or crooked nose;
     Can at her morning tea run o'er
     The scandal of the day before;
     Improving hourly in her skill,
     To cheat and wrangle at quadrille.
       In choosing lace, a critic nice,
     Knows to a groat the lowest price;
     Can in her female clubs dispute,
     What linen best the silk will suit,
     What colours each complexion match,
     And where with art to place a patch.
       If chance a mouse creeps in her sight,
     Can finely counterfeit a fright;
     So sweetly screams, if it comes near her,
     She ravishes all hearts to hear her.
     Can dext'rously her husband teaze,
     By taking fits whene'er she please;
     By frequent practice learns the trick
     At proper seasons to be sick;
     Thinks nothing gives one airs so pretty,
     At once creating love and pity;
     If Molly happens to be careless,
     And but neglects to warm her hair-lace,
     She gets a cold as sure as death,
     And vows she scarce can fetch her breath;
     Admires how modest women can
     Be so robustious like a man.
       In party, furious to her power;
     A bitter Whig, or Tory sour;
     Her arguments directly tend
     Against the side she would defend;
     Will prove herself a Tory plain,
     From principles the Whigs maintain;
     And, to defend the Whiggish cause,
     Her topics from the Tories draws.
       O yes! if any man can find
     More virtues in a woman's mind,
     Let them be sent to Mrs. Harding;[1]
     She'll pay the charges to a farthing;
     Take notice, she has my commission
     To add them in the next edition;
     They may outsell a better thing:
     So, holla, boys; God save the King!
