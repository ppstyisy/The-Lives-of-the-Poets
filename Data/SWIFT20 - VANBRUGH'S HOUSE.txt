     In times of old, when Time was young,
     And poets their own verses sung,
     A verse would draw a stone or beam,
     That now would overload a team;
     Lead 'em a dance of many a mile,
     Then rear 'em to a goodly pile.
     Each number had its diff'rent power;
     Heroic strains could build a tower;
     Sonnets and elegies to Chloris,
     Might raise a house about two stories;
     A lyric ode would slate; a catch
     Would tile; an epigram would thatch.
       Now Poets feel this art is lost,
     Both to their own and landlord's cost.
     Not one of all the tuneful throng
     Can hire a lodging for a song.
     For Jove consider'd well the case,
     That poets were a numerous race;
     And if they all had power to build,
     The earth would very soon be fill'd:
     Materials would be quickly spent,
     And houses would not give a rent.
     The God of Wealth was therefore made
     Sole patron of the building trade;
     Leaving to wits the spacious air,
     With license to build castles there:
     In right whereof their old pretence
     To lodge in garrets comes from thence.
     There is a worm by Phoebus bred,
     By leaves of mulberry is fed,
     Which unprovided where to dwell,
     Conforms itself to weave a cell;
     Then curious hands this texture take,
     And for themselves fine garments make.
     Meantime a pair of awkward things
     Grow to his back instead of wings;
     He flutters when he thinks he flies,
     Then sheds about his spawn and dies.
     Just such an insect of the age
     Is he that scribbles for the stage;
     His birth he does from Phoebus raise,
     And feeds upon imagin'd bays;
     Throws all his wit and hours away
     In twisting up an ill spun Play:
     This gives him lodging and provides
     A stock of tawdry shift besides.
     With the unravell'd shreds of which
     The under wits adorn their speech:
     And now he spreads his little fans,
     (For all the Muses Geese are Swans)
     And borne on Fancy's pinions, thinks
     He soars sublimest when he sinks:
     But scatt'ring round his fly-blows, dies;
     Whence broods of insect-poets rise.
       Premising thus, in modern way,
     The greater part I have to say;
     Sing, Muse, the house of Poet Van,
     In higher strain than we began.
       Van (for 'tis fit the reader know it)
     Is both a Herald and a Poet;
     No wonder then if nicely skill'd
     In each capacity to build.
     As Herald, he can in a day
     Repair a house gone to decay;
     Or by achievements, arms, device,
     Erect a new one in a trice;
     And poets, if they had their due,
     By ancient right are builders too:
     This made him to Apollo pray
     For leave to buildâ€”the poets way.
     His prayer was granted, for the God
     Consented with the usual nod.
       After hard throes of many a day
     Van was delivered of a play,
     Which in due time brought forth a house,
     Just as the mountain did the mouse.
     One story high, one postern door,
     And one small chamber on a floor,
     Born like a phoenix from the flame:
     But neither bulk nor shape the same;
     As animals of largest size
     Corrupt to maggots, worms, and flies;
     A type of modern wit and style,
     The rubbish of an ancient pile;
     So chemists boast they have a power,
     From the dead ashes of a flower
     Some faint resemblance to produce,
     But not the virtue, taste, nor juice.
     So modern rhymers strive to blast
     The poetry of ages past;
     Which, having wisely overthrown,
     They from its ruins build their own.
