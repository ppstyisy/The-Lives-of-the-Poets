     As clever Tom Clinch, while the rabble was bawling,
     Rode stately through Holborn to die in his calling,
     He stopt at the George for a bottle of sack,
     And promised to pay for it when he came back.
     His waistcoat, and stockings, and breeches, were white;
     His cap had a new cherry ribbon to tie't.
     The maids to the doors and the balconies ran,
     And said, "Lack-a-day, he's a proper young man!"
     But, as from the windows the ladies he spied,
     Like a beau in the box, he bow'd low on each side!
     And when his last speech the loud hawkers did cry,
     He swore from his cart, "It was all a damn'd lie!"
     The hangman for pardon fell down on his knee;
     Tom gave him a kick in the guts for his fee:
     Then said, I must speak to the people a little;
     But I'll see you all damn'd before I will whittle.[1]
     My honest friend Wild[2] (may he long hold his place)
     He lengthen'd my life with a whole year of grace.
     Take courage, dear comrades, and be not afraid,
     Nor slip this occasion to follow your trade;
     My conscience is clear, and my spirits are calm,
     And thus I go off, without prayer-book or psalm;
     Then follow the practice of clever Tom Clinch,
     Who hung like a hero, and never would flinch.
