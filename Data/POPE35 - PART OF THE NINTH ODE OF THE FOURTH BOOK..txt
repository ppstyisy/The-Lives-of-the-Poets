          1 Lest you should think that verse shall die,
              Which sounds the silver Thames along,
            Taught, on the wings of truth to fly
              Above the reach of vulgar song;

          2 Though daring Milton sits sublime,
              In Spenser, native Muses play;
            Nor yet shall Waller yield to time,
              Nor pensive Cowley's moral lay.

          3 Sages and chiefs long since had birth
              Ere Caesar was, or Newton named;
            These raised new empires o'er the earth,
              And those, new heavens and systems framed.

          4 Vain was the chief's, the sage's pride!
              They had no poet, and they died.
            In vain they schemed, in vain they bled!
              They had no poet, and are dead.
