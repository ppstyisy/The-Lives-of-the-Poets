     The queen has lately lost a part
     Of her ENTIRELY-ENGLISH[1] heart,
     For want of which, by way of botch,
     She pieced it up again with SCOTCH.
     Blest revolution! which creates
     Divided hearts, united states!
     See how the double nation lies,
     Like a rich coat with skirts of frize:
     As if a man, in making posies,
     Should bundle thistles up with roses.
     Who ever yet a union saw
     Of kingdoms without faith or law?[2]
     Henceforward let no statesman dare
     A kingdom to a ship compare;
     Lest he should call our commonweal
     A vessel with a double keel:
     Which, just like ours, new rigg'd and mann'd,
     And got about a league from land,
     By change of wind to leeward side,
     The pilot knew not how to guide.
     So tossing faction will o'erwhelm
     Our crazy double-bottom'd realm.
