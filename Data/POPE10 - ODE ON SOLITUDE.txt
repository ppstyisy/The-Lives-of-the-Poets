          1 Happy the man, whose wish and care
              A few paternal acres bound,
            Content to breathe his native air
                          In his own ground.

          2 Whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread,
              Whose flocks supply him with attire,
            Whose trees in summer yield him shade,
                          In winter fire.

          3 Blest, who can unconcern'dly find
              Hours, days, and years slide soft away,
            In health of body, peace of mind,
                          Quiet by day;

          4 Sound sleep by night; study and ease,
              Together mix'd; sweet recreation;
            And innocence, which most does please,
                          With meditation.

          5 Thus let me live, unseen, unknown,
              Thus unlamented let me die,
            Steal from the world, and not a stone
                          Tell where I lie.
