     Once on a time, as old stories rehearse,
       A friar would need show his talent in Latin;
     But was sorely put to 't in the midst of a verse,
       Because he could find no word to come pat in;
                Then all in the place
                He left a void space,
         And so went to bed in a desperate case:
     When behold the next morning a wonderful riddle!
     He found it was strangely fill'd up in the middle.
       CHO. Let censuring critics then think what they list on't;
         Who would not write verses with such an assistant?

     This put me the friar into an amazement;
       For he wisely consider'd it must be a sprite;
     That he came through the keyhole, or in at the casement;
       And it needs must be one that could both read and write;
              Yet he did not know,
              If it were friend or foe,
       Or whether it came from above or below;
     Howe'er, it was civil, in angel or elf,
     For he ne'er could have fill'd it so well of himself.

     Even so Master Doctor had puzzled his brains
       In making a ballad, but was at a stand;
     He had mixt little wit with a great deal of pains,
       When he found a new help from invisible hand.
             Then, good Doctor Swift
             Pay thanks for the gift,
       For you freely must own you were at a dead lift;
     And, though some malicious young spirit did do't,
     You may know by the hand it had no cloven foot.
         CHO. Let censuring, &c.
