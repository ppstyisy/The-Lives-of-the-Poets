     Here, five feet deep, lies on his back
     A cobbler, starmonger, and quack;
     Who to the stars, in pure good will,
     Does to his best look upward still.
     Weep, all you customers that use
     His pills, his almanacks, or shoes;
     And you that did your fortunes seek,
     Step to his grave but once a-week;
     This earth, which bears his body's print,
     You'll find has so much virtue in't,
     That I durst pawn my ears, 'twill tell
     Whate'er concerns you full as well,
     In physic, stolen goods, or love,
     As he himself could, when above.
