  ANSWER me when I call
  God of my righteousness;
  In straights and in distress
  Thou didst me disinthrall
  And set at large; now spare,
  Now pity me, and hear my earnest prai'r.

  Great ones how long will ye
  My glory have in scorn
  How long be thus forlorn
  Still to love vanity,                                                10
  To love, to seek, to prize
  Things false and vain and nothing else but lies?

  Yet know the Lord hath chose
  Chose to himself apart
  The good and meek of heart
  (For whom to chuse he knows)
  Jehovah from on high
  Will hear my voyce what time to him I crie.

  Be aw'd, and do not sin,
  Speak to your hearts alone,                                          20
  Upon your beds, each one,
  And be at peace within.
  Offer the offerings just
  Of righteousness and in Jehovah trust.

  Many there be that say
  Who yet will shew us good?
  Talking like this worlds brood;
  But Lord, thus let me pray,
  On us lift up the light
  Lift up the favour of thy count'nance bright.                        30

  Into my heart more joy
  And gladness thou hast put
  Then when a year of glut
  Their stores doth over-cloy
  And from their plenteous grounds
  With vast increase their corn and wine abounds.

  In peace at once will I
  Both lay me down and sleep
  For thou alone dost keep
  Me safe where ere I lie                                              40
  As in a rocky Cell
  Thou Lord alone in safety mak'st me dwell.
