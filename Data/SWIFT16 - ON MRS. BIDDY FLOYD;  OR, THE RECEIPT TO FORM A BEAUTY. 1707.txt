     When Cupid did his grandsire Jove entreat
     To form some Beauty by a new receipt, Jove sent, and found, far in a
     country scene,
     Truth, innocence, good nature, look serene:
     From which ingredients first the dext'rous boy
     Pick'd the demure, the awkward, and the coy.
     The Graces from the court did next provide
     Breeding, and wit, and air, and decent pride:
     These Venus cleans'd from ev'ry spurious grain
     Of nice coquet, affected, pert, and vain.
     Jove mix'd up all, and the best clay employ'd;
     Then call'd the happy composition FLOYD.
