     An ass's hoof alone can hold
     That poisonous juice, which kills by cold.
     Methought, when I this poem read,
     No vessel but an ass's head
     Such frigid fustian could contain;
     I mean, the head without the brain.
     The cold conceits, the chilling thoughts,
     Went down like stupifying draughts;
     I found my head begin to swim,
     A numbness crept through every limb.
     In haste, with imprecations dire,
     I threw the volume in the fire;
     When, (who could think?) though cold as ice,
     It burnt to ashes in a trice.
       How could I more enhance its fame?
     Though born in snow, it died in flame.
