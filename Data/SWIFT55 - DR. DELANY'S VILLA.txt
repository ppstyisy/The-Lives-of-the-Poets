     WOULD you that Delville I describe?
     Believe me, Sir, I will not gibe:
     For who would be satirical
     Upon a thing so very small?
       You scarce upon the borders enter,
     Before you're at the very centre.
     A single crow can make it night,
     When o'er your farm she takes her flight:
     Yet, in this narrow compass, we
     Observe a vast variety;
     Both walks, walls, meadows, and parterres,
     Windows and doors, and rooms and stairs,
     And hills and dales, and woods and fields,
     And hay, and grass, and corn, it yields:
     All to your haggard brought so cheap in,
     Without the mowing or the reaping:
     A razor, though to say't I'm loth,
     Would shave you and your meadows both.
       Though small's the farm, yet here's a house
     Full large to entertain a mouse;
     But where a rat is dreaded more
     Than savage Caledonian boar;
     For, if it's enter'd by a rat,
     There is no room to bring a cat.
       A little rivulet seems to steal
     Down through a thing you call a vale,
     Like tears adown a wrinkled cheek,
     Like rain along a blade of leek:
     And this you call your sweet meander,
     Which might be suck'd up by a gander,
     Could he but force his nether bill
     To scoop the channel of the rill.
     For sure you'd make a mighty clutter,
     Were it as big as city gutter.
     Next come I to your kitchen garden,
     Where one poor mouse would fare but hard in;
     And round this garden is a walk
     No longer than a tailor's chalk;
     Thus I compare what space is in it,
     A snail creeps round it in a minute.
     One lettuce makes a shift to squeeze
     Up through a tuft you call your trees:
     And, once a year, a single rose
     Peeps from the bud, but never blows;
     In vain then you expect its bloom!
     It cannot blow for want of room.
       In short, in all your boasted seat,
     There's nothing but yourself that's GREAT.
