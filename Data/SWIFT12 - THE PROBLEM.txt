THE PROBLEM,

     "THAT MY LORD BERKELEY STINKS WHEN HE IS IN LOVE"
     Did ever problem thus perplex,
     Or more employ the female sex?
     So sweet a passion who would think,
     Jove ever form'd to make a stink?
     The ladies vow and swear, they'll try,
     Whether it be a truth or lie.
     Love's fire, it seems, like inward heat,
     Works in my lord by stool and sweat,
     Which brings a stink from every pore,
     And from behind and from before;
     Yet what is wonderful to tell it,
     None but the favourite nymph can smell it.
     But now, to solve the natural cause
     By sober philosophic laws;
     Whether all passions, when in ferment,
     Work out as anger does in vermin;
     So, when a weasel you torment,
     You find his passion by his scent.
     We read of kings, who, in a fright,
     Though on a throne, would fall to sh—.
     Beside all this, deep scholars know,
     That the main string of Cupid's bow,
     Once on a time was an a— gut;
     Now to a nobler office put,
     By favour or desert preferr'd
     From giving passage to a t—;
     But still, though fix'd among the stars,
     Does sympathize with human a—.
     Thus, when you feel a hard-bound breech,
     Conclude love's bow-string at full stretch,
     Till the kind looseness comes, and then,
     Conclude the bow relax'd again.
       And now, the ladies all are bent,
     To try the great experiment,
     Ambitious of a regent's heart,
     Spread all their charms to catch a f—
     Watching the first unsavoury wind,
     Some ply before, and some behind.
     My lord, on fire amid the dames,
     F—ts like a laurel in the flames.
     The fair approach the speaking part,
     To try the back-way to his heart.
     For, as when we a gun discharge,
     Although the bore be none so large,
     Before the flame from muzzle burst,
     Just at the breech it flashes first;
     So from my lord his passion broke,
     He f—d first and then he spoke.
       The ladies vanish in the smother,
     To confer notes with one another;
     And now they all agreed to name
     Whom each one thought the happy dame.
     Quoth Neal, whate'er the rest may think,
     I'm sure 'twas I that smelt the stink.
     You smell the stink! by G—d, you lie,
     Quoth Ross, for I'll be sworn 'twas I.
     Ladies, quoth Levens, pray forbear;
     Let's not fall out; we all had share;
     And, by the most I can discover,
     My lord's a universal lover.
