     Virtue conceal'd within our breast
     Is inactivity at best:
     But never shall the Muse endure
     To let your virtues lie obscure;
     Or suffer Envy to conceal
     Your labours for the public weal.
     Within your breast all wisdom lies,
     Either to govern or advise;
     Your steady soul preserves her frame,
     In good and evil times, the same.
     Pale Avarice and lurking Fraud,
     Stand in your sacred presence awed;
     Your hand alone from gold abstains,
     Which drags the slavish world in chains.
       Him for a happy man I own,
     Whose fortune is not overgrown;[2]
     And happy he who wisely knows
     To use the gifts that Heaven bestows;
     Or, if it please the powers divine,
     Can suffer want and not repine.
     The man who infamy to shun
     Into the arms of death would run;
     That man is ready to defend,
     With life, his country or his friend.
