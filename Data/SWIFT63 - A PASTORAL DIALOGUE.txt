     In spight of Pope, in spight of Gay,
     And all that he or they can say;
     Sing on I must, and sing I will,
     Of Richmond Lodge and Marble Hill.
       Last Friday night, as neighbours use,
     This couple met to talk of news:
     For, by old proverbs, it appears,
     That walls have tongues, and hedges ears.

     MARBLE HILL

     Quoth Marble Hill, right well I ween,
     Your mistress now is grown a queen;
     You'll find it soon by woful proof,
     She'll come no more beneath your roof.

     RICHMOND LODGE

     The kingly prophet well evinces,
     That we should put no trust in princes:
     My royal master promised me
     To raise me to a high degree:
     But now he's grown a king, God wot,
     I fear I shall be soon forgot.
     You see, when folks have got their ends,
     How quickly they neglect their friends;
     Yet I may say, 'twixt me and you,
     Pray God, they now may find as true!

     MARBLE HILL

     My house was built but for a show,
     My lady's empty pockets know;
     And now she will not have a shilling,
     To raise the stairs, or build the ceiling;
     For all the courtly madams round
     Now pay four shillings in the pound;
     'Tis come to what I always thought:
     My dame is hardly worth a groat.[2]
     Had you and I been courtiers born,
     We should not thus have lain forlorn;
     For those we dext'rous courtiers call,
     Can rise upon their masters' fall:
     But we, unlucky and unwise,
     Must fall because our masters rise.

     RICHMOND LODGE

     My master, scarce a fortnight since,
     Was grown as wealthy as a prince;
     But now it will be no such thing,
     For he'll be poor as any king;
     And by his crown will nothing get,
     But like a king to run in debt.

     MARBLE HILL

     No more the Dean, that grave divine,
     Shall keep the key of my (no) wine;
     My ice-house rob, as heretofore,
     And steal my artichokes no more;
     Poor Patty Blount[3] no more be seen
     Bedraggled in my walks so green:
     Plump Johnny Gay will now elope;
     And here no more will dangle Pope.

     RICHMOND LODGE

     Here wont the Dean, when he's to seek,
     To spunge a breakfast once a-week;
     To cry the bread was stale, and mutter
     Complaints against the royal butter.
     But now I fear it will be said,
     No butter sticks upon his bread.[4]
     We soon shall find him full of spleen,
     For want of tattling to the queen;
     Stunning her royal ears with talking;
     His reverence and her highness walking:
     While Lady Charlotte,[5] like a stroller,
     Sits mounted on the garden-roller.
     A goodly sight to see her ride,
     With ancient Mirmont[6] at her side.
     In velvet cap his head lies warm,
     His hat, for show, beneath his arm.

     MARBLE HILL

     Some South-Sea broker from the city
     Will purchase me, the more's the pity;
     Lay all my fine plantations waste,
     To fit them to his vulgar taste:
     Chang'd for the worse in ev'ry part,
     My master Pope will break his heart.

     RICHMOND LODGE

     In my own Thames may I be drownded,
     If e'er I stoop beneath a crown'd head:
     Except her majesty prevails
     To place me with the Prince of Wales;
     And then I shall be free from fears,
     For he'll be prince these fifty years.
     I then will turn a courtier too,
     And serve the times as others do.
     Plain loyalty, not built on hope,
     I leave to your contriver, Pope;
     None loves his king and country better,
     Yet none was ever less their debtor.

     MARBLE HILL

     Then let him come and take a nap
     In summer on my verdant lap;
     Prefer our villas, where the Thames is,
     To Kensington, or hot St. James's;
     Nor shall I dull in silence sit;
     For 'tis to me he owes his wit;
     My groves, my echoes, and my birds,
     Have taught him his poetic words.
     We gardens, and you wildernesses,
     Assist all poets in distresses.
     Him twice a-week I here expect,
     To rattle Moody[7] for neglect;
     An idle rogue, who spends his quartridge
     In tippling at the Dog and Partridge;
     And I can hardly get him down
     Three times a-week to brush my gown.

     RICHMOND LODGE

     I pity you, dear Marble Hill;
     But hope to see you flourish still.
     All happinessâ€”and so adieu.

     MARBLE HILL

     Kind Richmond Lodge, the same to you.
