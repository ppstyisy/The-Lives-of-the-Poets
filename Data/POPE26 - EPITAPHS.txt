          I. ON CHARLES EARL OF DORSET, IN THE CHURCH OF WITHYAM, IN SUSSEX.

          'His saltem accumulem donis, et fungar inani Munere!'

          VIRG.

          Dorset, the grace of courts, the Muses' pride,
          Patron of arts, and judge of nature, died.
          The scourge of pride, though sanctified or great,
          Of fops in learning, and of knaves in state:
          Yet soft his nature, though severe his lay,
          His anger moral, and his wisdom gay.
          Bless'd satirist! who touch'd the mean so true,
          As show'd vice had his hate and pity too.
          Blest courtier! who could king and country please,
          Yet sacred keep his friendships, and his ease.
          Blest peer! his great forefathers' every grace
          Reflecting, and reflected in his race;
          Where other Buckhursts, other Dorsets shine,
          And patriots still, or poets, deck the line.
          II. ON SIR WILLIAM TRUMBULL.81

          A pleasing form; a firm, yet cautious mind;
          Sincere, though prudent; constant, yet resign'd:
          Honour unchanged, a principle profess'd,
          Fix'd to one side, but moderate to the rest:
          An honest courtier, yet a patriot too;
          Just to his prince, and to his country true:
          Fill'd with the sense of age, the fire of youth,
          A scorn of wrangling, yet a zeal for truth;
          A generous faith, from superstition free:
          A love to peace, and hate of tyranny;
          Such this man was; who now, from earth removed,
          At length enjoys that liberty he loved.
          III. ON THE HON. SIMON HARCOURT, ONLY SON OF THE LORD CHANCELLOR
          HARCOURT, AT THE CHURCH OF STANTON HARCOURT, IN OXFORDSHIRE, 1720.

          To this sad shrine, whoe'er thou art, draw near;
          Here lies the friend most loved, the son most dear:
          Who ne'er knew joy, but friendship might divide,
          Or gave his father grief but when he died.

          How vain is reason, eloquence how weak!
          If Pope must tell what Harcourt cannot speak.
          Oh, let thy once-loved friend inscribe thy stone,
          And, with a father's sorrows, mix his own!
          IV. ON JAMES CRAGGS, ESQ. IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.

          JACOBUS CRAGGS REGI MAGNAE BRITANNIA A SECRETIS ET CONSILIIS
          SANCTIORIBUS, PRINCIPIS PARITER AC POPULI AMOR ET DELICIAE: VIXIT
          TITULIS ET INVIDIA MAJOR ANNOS, HEU PAUCOS, XXXV. OB.
          FEB. XVI.   MDCCXX.

          Statesman, yet friend to Truth! of soul sincere,
          In action faithful, and in honour clear!
          Who broke no promise, served no private end,
          Who gain'd no title, and who lost no friend;
          Ennobled by himself, by all approved,
          Praised, wept, and honour'd by the Muse he loved.
          V. INTENDED FOR MR ROWE, IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.

          Thy relics, Rowe, to this fair urn we trust,
          And sacred place by Dryden's awful dust:
          Beneath a rude and nameless stone he lies,
          To which thy tomb shall guide inquiring eyes.
          Peace to thy gentle shade, and endless rest!
          Blest in thy genius, in thy love, too, blest!
          One grateful woman to thy fame supplies
          What a whole thankless land to his denies.
          VI. ON MRS CORBET, WHO DIED OF A CANCER IN HER BREAST.

          Here rests a woman, good without pretence,
          Blest with plain reason, and with sober sense:
          No conquests she, but o'er herself, desired,
          No arts essay'd, but not to be admired.
          Passion and pride were to her soul unknown,
          Convinced that virtue only is our own.
          So unaffected, so composed a mind;
          So firm, yet soft; so strong, yet so refined;
          Heaven, as its purest gold, by tortures tried;
          The saint sustain'd it, but the woman died.
          VII. ON THE MONUMENT OF THE HONOURABLE EGBERT DIGBY, AND HIS SISTER
          MARY.

          ERECTED BY THEIR FATHER THE LORD DIGBY, IN THE CHURCH OF SHERBORNE, IN
          DORSETSHIRE, 1727.

          Go! fair example of untainted youth,
          Of modest wisdom, and pacific truth:
          Composed in sufferings, and in joy sedate,
          Good without noise, without pretension great.
          Just of thy word, in every thought sincere,
          Who knew no wish but what the world might hear:
          Of softest manners, unaffected mind,
          Lover of peace, and friend of human kind:
          Go live! for Heaven's eternal year is thine,82
          Go, and exalt thy moral to divine.

          And thou, bless'd maid! attendant on his doom,
          Pensive hast follow'd to the silent tomb,
          Steer'd the same course to the same quiet shore,
          Not parted long, and now to part no more!
          Go then, where only bliss sincere is known!
          Go, where to love and to enjoy are one!

          Yet take these tears, Mortality's relief,
          And till we share your joys, forgive our grief:
          These little rites, a stone, a verse receive;
          'Tis all a father, all a friend can give!
          VIII. ON SIR GODFREY KNELLER, IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY, 1723.

          Kneller, by Heaven, and not a master, taught,
          Whose art was Nature, and whose pictures Thought;
          Now for two ages having snatch'd from Fate
          Whate'er was beauteous, or whate'er was great,
          Lies crown'd with princes' honours, poets' lays,
          Due to his merit, and brave thirst of praise.

          Living, great Nature fear'd he might outvie
          Her works; and, dying, fears herself may die.
          IX. ON GENERAL HENRY WITHERS, IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY, 1729.

          Here, Withers, rest! thou bravest, gentlest mind,
          Thy country's friend, but more of human kind.
          Oh, born to arms! oh, worth in youth approved!
          Oh, soft humanity, in age beloved!
          For thee the hardy veteran drops a tear,
          And the gay courtier feels the sigh sincere.
          Withers, adieu! yet not with thee remove
          Thy martial spirit, or thy social love!
          Amidst corruption, luxury, and rage,
          Still leave some ancient virtues to our age:
          Nor let us say (those English glories gone)
          The last true Briton lies beneath this stone.
          X. ON MR ELIJAH FENTON,83 AT EASTHAMSTEAD, IN BERKS, 1730.

          This modest stone, what few vain marbles can,
          May truly say, Here lies an honest man:
          A poet, blest beyond the poet's fate,
          Whom Heaven kept sacred from the proud and great:
          Foe to loud praise, and friend to learnèd ease,
          Content with science in the vale of peace.
          Calmly he look'd on either life, and here
          Saw nothing to regret, or there to fear;
          From Nature's temperate feast rose satisfied,
          Thank'd Heaven that he had lived, and that he died.
          XI. ON MR GAY, IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY, 1732.

          Of manners gentle, of affections mild;
          In wit, a man; simplicity, a child:
          With native humour tempering virtuous rage,
          Form'd to delight at once and lash the age:
          Above temptation in a low estate,
          And uncorrupted, even among the great:
          A safe companion, and an easy friend,
          Unblamed through life, lamented in thy end.
          These are thy honours! not that here thy bust
          Is mix'd with heroes, or with kings thy dust;
          But that the worthy and the good shall say,
          Striking their pensive bosoms—Here lies Gay.
          XII. INTENDED FOR SIR ISAAC NEWTON, IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.

              ISAACUS NEWTONUS:
              QUEM IMMORTALEM
          TESTANTUR TEMPUS, NATURA, COELUM:
                MORTALEM
              HOC MARMOR FATETUR.
          Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night
          God said, Let Newton be! and all was light.
          XIII. ON DR FRANCIS ATTERBURY,84 BISHOP OF ROCHESTER, WHO DIED
          IN EXILE AT PARIS, 1732.

          SHE.

          Yes, we have lived—one pang, and then we part!
          May Heaven, dear father! now have all thy heart.
          Yet ah! how once we loved, remember still,
          Till you are dust like me.

          HE.
                                     Dear shade! I will:
          Then mix this dust with thine—O spotless ghost!
          O more than fortune, friends, or country lost!
          Is there on earth one care, one wish beside?
          Yes—Save my country, Heaven!
                                   —He said, and died.
          XIV. ON EDMUND DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM, WHO DIED IN THE NINETEENTH YEAR OF
          HIS AGE, 1735.

          If modest youth, with cool reflection crown'd,
          And every opening virtue blooming round,
          Could save a parent's justest pride from fate,
          Or add one patriot to a sinking state;
          This weeping marble had not ask'd thy tear,
          Or sadly told how many hopes lie here!
          The living virtue now had shone approved,
          The senate heard him, and his country loved.
          Yet softer honours, and less noisy fame
          Attend the shade of gentle Buckingham:
          In whom a race, for courage famed and art,
          Ends in the milder merit of the heart;
          And chiefs or sages long to Britain given,
          Pays the last tribute of a saint to Heaven.
          XV. FOR ONE WHO WOULD NOT BE BURIED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.

          Heroes and kings! your distance keep:
          In peace let one poor poet sleep,
          Who never flatter'd folks like you:
          Let Horace blush, and Virgil too.
          XVI. ANOTHER, ON THE SAME.

          Under this marble, or under this sill,
          Or under this turf, or e'en what they will;
          Whatever an heir, or a friend in his stead,
          Or any good creature shall lay o'er my head,
          Lies one who ne'er cared, and still cares not a pin
          What they said, or may say, of the mortal within:
          But who, living and dying, serene still and free,
          Trusts in God, that as well as he was, he shall be.
          XVII. ON TWO LOVERS STRUCK DEAD BY LIGHTNING.85

          When Eastern lovers feed the funeral fire,
          On the same pile the faithful pair expire.
          Here pitying Heaven that virtue mutual found,
          And blasted both, that it might neither wound.
          Hearts so sincere, the Almighty saw well pleased,
          Sent his own lightning, and the victims seized.
          [Lord Harcourt, on whose property the unfortunate pair lived, was
          apprehensive that the country people would not understand the
          above, and Pope wrote the subjoined]:—

              NEAR THIS PLACE LIE THE BODIES OF
                JOHN HEWET AND SARAH DREW,
                  AN INDUSTRIOUS YOUNG MAN,
            AND VIRTUOUS MAIDEN OF THIS PARISH;
                  WHO, BEING AT HARVEST-WORK
                   (WITH SEVERAL OTHERS),
          WERE IN ONE INSTANT KILLED BY LIGHTNING,
                  THE LAST DAY OF JULY 1718.

          Think not, by rigorous judgment seized,
            A pair so faithful could expire;
          Victims so pure Heaven saw well pleased,
            And snatch'd them in celestial fire.

          Live well, and fear no sudden fate;
            When God calls virtue to the grave,
          Alike 'tis justice soon or late,
            Mercy alike to kill or save.

          Virtue unmoved can hear the call,
            And face the flash that melts the ball.
