     The thresher Duck[1] could o'er the queen prevail,
     The proverb says, "no fence against a flail."
     From threshing corn he turns to thresh his brains;
     For which her majesty allows him grains:
     Though 'tis confest, that those, who ever saw
     His poems, think them all not worth a straw!
       Thrice happy Duck, employ'd in threshing stubble,
     Thy toil is lessen'd, and thy profits double.
