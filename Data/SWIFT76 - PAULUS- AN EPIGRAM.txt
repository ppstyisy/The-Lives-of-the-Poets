     "A SLAVE to crowds, scorch'd with the summer's heats,
     In courts the wretched lawyer toils and sweats;
     While smiling Nature, in her best attire,
     Regales each sense, and vernal joys inspire.
     Can he, who knows that real good should please,
     Barter for gold his liberty and ease?"—
     This Paulus preach'd:—When, entering at the door,
     Upon his board the client pours the ore:
     He grasps the shining gift, pores o'er the cause,
     Forgets the sun, and dozes on the laws.
