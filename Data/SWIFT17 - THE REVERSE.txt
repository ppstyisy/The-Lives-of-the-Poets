     Venus one day, as story goes,
     But for what reason no man knows,
     In sullen mood and grave deport,
     Trudged it away to Jove's high court;
     And there his Godship did entreat
     To look out for his best receipt:
     And make a monster strange and odd,
     Abhorr'd by man and every god.
     Jove, ever kind to all the fair,
     Nor e'er refused a lady's prayer,
     Straight oped 'scrutoire, and forth he took
     A neatly bound and well-gilt book;
     Sure sign that nothing enter'd there,
     But what was very choice and rare.
     Scarce had he turn'd a page or two,—
     It might be more, for aught I knew;
     But, be the matter more or less,
     'Mong friends 'twill break no squares, I guess.
     Then, smiling, to the dame quoth he,
     Here's one will fit you to a T.
     But, as the writing doth prescribe,
     'Tis fit the ingredients we provide.
     Away he went, and search'd the stews,
     And every street about the Mews;
     Diseases, impudence, and lies,
     Are found and brought him in a trice.
     From Hackney then he did provide,
     A clumsy air and awkward pride;
     From lady's toilet next he brought
     Noise, scandal, and malicious thought.
     These Jove put in an old close-stool,
     And with them mix'd the vain, the fool.
       But now came on his greatest care,
     Of what he should his paste prepare;
     For common clay or finer mould
     Was much too good, such stuff to hold.
     At last he wisely thought on mud;
     So raised it up, and call'd it—Cludd.
     With this, the lady well content,
     Low curtsey'd, and away she went.
