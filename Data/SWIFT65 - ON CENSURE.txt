     Ye wise, instruct me to endure
     An evil, which admits no cure;
     Or, how this evil can be borne,
     Which breeds at once both hate and scorn.
     Bare innocence is no support,
     When you are tried in Scandal's court.
     Stand high in honour, wealth, or wit;
     All others, who inferior sit,
     Conceive themselves in conscience bound
     To join, and drag you to the ground.
     Your altitude offends the eyes
     Of those who want the power to rise.
     The world, a willing stander-by,
     Inclines to aid a specious lie:
     Alas! they would not do you wrong;
     But all appearances are strong.
       Yet whence proceeds this weight we lay
     On what detracting people say!
     For let mankind discharge their tongues
     In venom, till they burst their lungs,
     Their utmost malice cannot make
     Your head, or tooth, or finger ache;
     Nor spoil your shape, distort your face,
     Or put one feature out of place;
     Nor will you find your fortune sink
     By what they speak or what they think;
     Nor can ten hundred thousand lies
     Make you less virtuous, learn'd, or wise.
       The most effectual way to balk
     Their malice, isâ€”to let them talk.
