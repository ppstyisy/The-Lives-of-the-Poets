     Our schoolmaster may roar i' th' fit,
       Of classic beauty, haec et illa;
     Not all his birch inspires such wit
       As th'ogling beams of Domitilla.

     Let nobles toast, in bright champaign,
       Nymphs higher born than Domitilla;
     I'll drink her health, again, again,
       In Berkeley's tar,[2] or sars'parilla.

     At Goodman's Fields I've much admired
       The postures strange of Monsieur Brilla;
     But what are they to the soft step,
       The gliding air of Domitilla?

     Virgil has eternized in song
       The flying footsteps of Camilla;[3]
     Sure, as a prophet, he was wrong;
       He might have dream'd of Domitilla.

     Great Theodose condemn'd a town
       For thinking ill of his Placilla:[4]
     And deuce take London! if some knight
       O' th' city wed not Domitilla.

     Wheeler,[5] Sir George, in travels wise,
       Gives us a medal of Plantilla;
     But O! the empress has not eyes,
       Nor lips, nor breast, like Domitilla.

     Not all the wealth of plunder'd Italy,
       Piled on the mules of king At-tila,
     Is worth one glove (I'll not tell a bit a lie)
       Or garter, snatch'd from Domitilla.

     Five years a nymph at certain hamlet,
       Y-cleped Harrow of the Hill, a-
     —bused much my heart, and was a damn'd let
       To verse—but now for Domitilla.

     Dan Pope consigns Belinda's watch
       To the fair sylphid Momentilla,[6]
     And thus I offer up my catch
       To the snow-white hands of Domitilla.
