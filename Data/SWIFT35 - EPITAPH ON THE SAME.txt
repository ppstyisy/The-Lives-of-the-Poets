     Beneath this verdant hillock lies
     Demar, the wealthy and the wise,
     His heirs,[1] that he might safely rest,
     Have put his carcass in a chest;
     The very chest in which, they say,
     His other self, his money, lay.
     And, if his heirs continue kind
     To that dear self he left behind,
     I dare believe, that four in five
     Will think his better self alive.
