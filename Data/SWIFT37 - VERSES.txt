     Are the guests of this house still doom'd to be cheated?
     Sure the Fates have decreed they by halves should be treated.
     In the days of good John[1] if you came here to dine,
     You had choice of good meat, but no choice of good wine.
     In Jonathan's reign, if you come here to eat,
     You have choice of good wine, but no choice of good meat.
     O Jove! then how fully might all sides be blest,
     Wouldst thou but agree to this humble request!
     Put both deans in one; or, if that's too much trouble,
     Instead of the deans, make the deanery double.
